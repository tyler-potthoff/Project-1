    "## Organizing Data \n",
    "Performing initial exploratory analysis of big data sets is becoming a critical skill for civil and environmental engineers.  Data sets are getting bigger over time and that makes it more difficult to determine how the data impacts our designs and decision making as an engineer.  If we can quickly explore the data to determine if it is useful to us, this will help us quickly and effectively tell our clients what they want to know.  This lab is dedicated to teaching you how to organize data, including filtering, grouping, aggregating and categorizing.  Let's get started!"
