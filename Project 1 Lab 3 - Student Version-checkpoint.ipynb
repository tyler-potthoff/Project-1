For example, our temperature data in this data set is numerical, but the UNMC Group has defined temperature categories. We may want to create a new column that \"looks\" at the temperature column and then assigns a category to each temperature in a new column.  Every function starts with `def`.  Then the blue text after `def` is the name of your function.  Your function takes `arguments`, variables that can be inputed to the function. Don't forget to put `:` after your arguments so that Python knows to indent!  Then we use a series of `elif` statements to define what happens to the variable when it is put into the function.  "
