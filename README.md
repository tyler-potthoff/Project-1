## Prompts
 1. What are the 5 locations in Nebraska with the highest mean and median concentrations of VOC, PM 2.5 and PM 10.0?
 2. On what days did the maximum values occur and where did this maximums occur?
 3. Does humidity and temperature have a noticeable effect on air quality?
 4. Have there been any Air Quality Index (AQI) health risks (unhealthy for sensitive populations) at any of the locations in the dataset for PM 2.5 and PM 10 based on the EPA’s AQI ratings?
 5. Does the sensor altitude have an impact on the air quality values?
